  Within the Library System, the "Book" and "ElectronicResources" classes were derived from the "LibraryResources" class, leveraging their shared attributes. Both classes, for instance, require Author, Title, and ISBN for effective library resource management. 
  The "printResourcesDetails" method, inherited from the "LibraryResources" class, serves to display relevant information pertaining to specific library resources. However, this method has been slightly modified within the "Book" and "ElectronicResources" classes to better accommodate the unique characteristics of each resource type.
